##  Aims and Scope

Signal Processing deals with the extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This process has two distinct aspects: characterization, and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms and operations, whereas categorization and classification are operations associated with the use of statistical tools.

Machine learning uses statistical techniques to design algorithms that give computer systems the ability to learn about the state of the world directly from data. In the context of Computer Science, to learn can be explicitly defined as to improve performance on a specific task progressively, without being explicitly programmed. An increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning algorithms to both aspects of signal processing.

In this course, we discuss the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data-driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.

In this course, the student will obtain proficiency in:

- Machine learning concepts: methods of modeling, estimation, classification, and prediction.
- In sound processing: such as denoising and separating sounds in mixtures.
- In image processing and computer vision: such as image restoration,
object detection, recognition, biometrics.
- In carrying out the software implementation in simple applications.
Prior knowledge of this course includes probability, linear algebra, and calculus. Programming experience in MATLAB is desirable, but not required.

<!-- ## Outline

This is a new course, this website will be updated as we go along.

### Lecture 1: Introduction

We will be discussing the main aspects about metrology and why it is so important in manufacturing.
